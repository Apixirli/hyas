**DESCRIPTION**:
Recreation of Nanyang Technological University's Yunnan Garden (pre-2019) in Virtual Reality. Land topology and foliage locations based on land surveys available. Structures modelled based on photogrammetry captures. Rock sculptures based on photogrammetry captures. Paths and drains procedurally modelled in Houdini. Completed level is then being used as a stage for further interactions and experiences such as an "I-Ching simulator" and "Particle-based traditional dance experience". Currently runs at a stable 45fps on the Vive Pro with the Forward Renderer, pending further optimizations.
